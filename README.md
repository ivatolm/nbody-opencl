# NBody-OpenCL

# Introduction
This repository contains implementation of N-body simulation, written based on OpenCL library.

In this not so good implementation I was able to run n=100000 at a low framerate of 5.

## Remark
Nobody tried to run the project on any software of hardware except
```
Software: Linux 5.10.59-1-MANJARO
Hardware (Graphics): Geforce GTX 1060 6GB
```

# Installation and running
Required dependencies are `SFML` and `OpenCL`.

To compile and execute a simulation, run `make` in the root of the project.
